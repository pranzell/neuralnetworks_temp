    "Create a Neural Network that takes in a single greyscale image that is 30 by 30. The network will have two filters, each that use a different 3 by 3 kernel to filter the image using the Keras Conv2D default for the stride and the padding as “same”. The next step in the network will perform 2 by 2 max pooling. The next step will use 4 filters (each with its own 3 by 3 kernel – stride (1,1) – and padding = “same”). The next step will be 2 by 2 max pooling. The next step will flatten and send into a fully connected NN. The output will have three units (three outputs are generated) and will use softmax. All other activation functions (except the last which is softmax) will be ReLU. \n",

    "a)\tDraw this architecture. Make sure it is fully labeled with all sizes and shapes as well as other critical elements. \n",
    "\n",
    "b)\tCreate this architecture in Keras and paste the code here. Specifically, you will need to paste the code your used to define the model, to summarize the model, and to compile the model. In the compile portion, you can use “adam”, “categorical_crossentropy”, and “accuracy” for your metrics. You will not include fitting or running the model. Please also paste the results of your model summary here.  \n",
